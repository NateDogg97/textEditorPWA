## Description

[Visit the deployed Progressive Web Application](https://serene-headland-70496.herokuapp.com/)

This is a single page application that features a number of data persistance techniques that serves as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline. The motivation behind this application was power outages and spotty internet. This application may be downloaded and used offline. I built this project to practice Progressive Web Application techniques as this is a valuable skill to have in the modern job market. Progressive Web Applications like this one are fast and able to be downloaded and used offline. They are able to use the browser cache to store data that make the application load faster and demand less internet bandwidth. I learned about the client server method of encapsulation and webpack plugin techniques. Webpack plugin takes the files in a folder and compiles them into smaller files to speed up performance.

## Installation

The application is deployed on Heroku, but if you'd like to clone the repo to your local machine, feel free. The deployed app has a button that allows the user to install the appl to their local machine to be used offline. If you would like to run the app after cloning the repo however, follow these steps: Open an Integrated terminal on the root package.json file. Run `npm install` followed by `npm run build`. Then execute the command `npm start` or `npm start:dev` and navigate your browser to localhost:3000.

## Usage

Type your text in the broswer window or install the app to go offline. The app will use the browser cache to store data.

## Contributing

If you want to make changes to the application create a separate repository to push to.

## Tests

Testing is done through using the app.
